    Disclaimers<br>

    Limitation of Liability<br>

    Application of Limitations and Disclaimers to Consumers.  Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages with respect to consumers (i.e., a person acquiring goods otherwise than in the course of a business), so the exclusions set forth in the Sections 9 and 10 above may not apply to you if you are a consumer. The limitations or exclusions of warranties and liability contained in these Terms do not affect or prejudice the statutory rights of a consumer.  The limitations or exclusions of warranties and remedies contained in these Terms shall apply to a consumer only to the extent such limitations or exclusions and remedies are permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction where such consumer is located.

    Availability of the Service. Information describing the Service is accessible worldwide but this does not mean the Service or certain portions thereof are available in your country. We may restrict access to the Service or portions thereof in certain countries. It is your responsibility to make sure that your use of the Service is legal in your country of residence. The Service may not be available in all languages. If at our reasonable determination, you use the Service or any other material or services provided by us to you under these Terms in a manner that violates laws, or creates an excessive burden or potential adverse impact on our systems, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies, we may, without liability to us, immediately suspend or terminate your access to the Service.

          <h1><b>Privacy</b></h1>

          Not A Basement Studio Ltd. ("Not A Basement Studio") operates several websites & mobile apps including
          mangarock.com, mangarockapp.com, notabasement.com, Manga Rock - Best Manga Reader. It is Not A Basement
          Studio’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

          <p>
          <h3><b>Visitors</b></h3>
          </p>
          Like most website operators, Not A Basement Studio collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
          that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
          referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Not A Basement Studio’s purpose in collecting
          non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Not A Basement Studio’ visitors use its
          websites & apps. From time to time, Not A Basement Studio may release non-personally-identifying information
          in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites & apps. Not A Basement
          Studio also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for
          logged in users and for users leaving comments on Not A Basement Studio posts. Not A Basement Studio only
          discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
          personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and
          disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.<br>

          <p>
          <h3><b>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</b></h3>
          </p>
          Certain visitors to Not A Basement Studio’s websites & users of Not A Basement Studio’s apps choose to
          interact with Not A Basement Studio in ways that require Not A Basement Studio to gather
          personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Not A Basement Studio gathers
          depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors to share a photo on Facebook to provide

          necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Not A Basement Studio. For
          example, Not A Basement Studio only asks for Camera or Photo permission when users want to change their
          account’s avatar using their device’s photo, or Not A Basement Studio will only asks for a user’s email
          address if a user would like to share to Facebook or Twitter from Not A Basement Studio’s websites or apps.
          Not A Basement Studio does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
          visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent
          them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
